# Skill Output Patterns

## File Generation

When a skill generates files:
1. Confirm the output path with the user
2. Create parent directories as needed
3. Use descriptive filenames
4. Report what was created

## Interactive Workflows

For multi-step tasks:
1. Present the plan before executing
2. Allow the user to modify the approach
3. Show progress at each step
4. Summarize results at the end

## Error Recovery

When things go wrong:
1. Explain what happened clearly
2. Suggest alternatives
3. Preserve any partial work
4. Never silently fail
