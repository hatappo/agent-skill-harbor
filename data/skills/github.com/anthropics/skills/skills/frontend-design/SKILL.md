# Frontend Design

Create memorable, distinctive interfaces. Avoid generic "AI slop" - every design should have a clear point of view.

## Design Philosophy

1. **Bold choices**: Pick a strong color palette, unusual typography, or distinctive layout
2. **Purposeful whitespace**: Let content breathe, don't fill every pixel
3. **Visual hierarchy**: Make the important things impossible to miss
4. **Micro-interactions**: Add subtle animations that delight

## Technical Stack

- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Use CSS Grid for complex layouts, Flexbox for simpler ones

## Anti-patterns

- Generic blue/white SaaS layouts
- Overuse of rounded corners and soft shadows
- Cards inside cards inside cards
- Gratuitous gradient backgrounds
